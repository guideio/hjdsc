Please perform a complete design system audit for this entire app.

Evaluate how the components, styles, and assets are structured, organized, and documented
after the reorganization process. Generate a detailed Markdown report in the `/reports` folder.

🔍 AUDIT SCOPE
================
1. 🧩 Component Structure  
   - Review how each component or page is organized under its respective folders  
   - Check naming conventions, hierarchy, and reusability  

2. 🎨 Design Consistency  
   - Evaluate token usage (color, spacing, typography, etc.)  
   - Verify that shared styles (global-styles.css, tokens.css, special-cases.css) are consistently applied  
   - Identify redundant or conflicting style definitions  

3. ⚙️ Technical Implementation  
   - Check for semantic HTML and accessibility  
   - Validate CSS organization, imports, and maintainability  
   - Confirm that JS utilities and scripts are modular and scoped properly  

4. 📚 Documentation & Clarity  
   - Verify that each component, page, or section includes brief documentation  
   - Ensure the main README.md and folder-level READMEs describe structure and purpose  

5. 🚀 Optimization Opportunities  
   - Identify files or components that could be simplified, merged, or re-abstracted  
   - Suggest performance or maintainability improvements  


Produce design reports  named `XX-DESIGN-AUDITS.md` inside `/reports/`.  
Organize findings under the above sections and include specific recommendations
for improving clarity, scalability, and design consistency across the system.
